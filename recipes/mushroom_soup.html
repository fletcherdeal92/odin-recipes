    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is one of my favorite soups of all time. It is so easy. The secret to this deep, rich soup is a long slow caramelization, the key to unlocking the mushroom's magic. This is just pure essence of mushroom.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 pounds sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, diced  </li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves for garnish, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat; cook mushrooms in butter with 1 pinch salt until the mushrooms give off their juices; reduce heat to low. Continue to cook, stirring often, until juices evaporate and the mushrooms are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Set aside a few attractive mushroom slices for garnish later, if desired. Mix onion into mushrooms and cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir flour into mushroom mixture and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes to remove raw flour taste. Tie thyme sprigs into a small bundle with kitchen twine and add to mushroom mixture; add garlic cloves. Pour chicken stock and water into mushroom mixture. Bring to a simmer and cook for 1 hour. Remove thyme bundle.</li>
        <li>Transfer soup to a blender in small batches and puree on high speed until smooth and thick.</li>
        <li>Return soup to pot and stir in cream. Season with salt and black pepper and serve in bowls, garnished with reserved mushroom slices and a few thyme leaves.</li>
    </ol>
